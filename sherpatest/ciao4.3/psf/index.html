  <h1>  The Sherpa PSF Interface  </h1>

  <hr/>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>
  Sherpa now has a convolution kernel that can handle PSF
  data.  The source data and PSF are read into separate
  Sherpa datasets appropriate to its file spec.

  The user has the ability to create a 'psf' model object
  and set the proper parameters.  These psf model parameters differ
  from the ones found in Sherpa 3.4.  Dimensionality is now determined by the
  user.
  </p>

  <p>
  In this thread we show a simple example of how to use the new psf
  interface in Sherpa.
  </p>

  <h2>Load Data + PSF</h2>

  <p>
  The FITS image file <a href="center_box_0.25pix.fits">
  <tt>center_box_0.25pix.fits</tt></a> is an
  ordinary FITS image file.  One can load an image as a
  Sherpa data set with the <tt>load_image</tt> function.
  The PSF file <a href="psf_f1_norm_0.25pix.fits"> 
  <tt>psf_f1_norm_0.25pix.fits</tt></a>, can be defined as a PSF
  model where the convolution will be done using FFT. 
  The PSF image can be created as a model with the id 'psf'
  using the <tt>load_psf</tt> function.
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">
  In : load_image("center_box_0.25pix.fits")
  
  In : load_psf("psf", "psf_f1_norm_0.25pix.fits")
  </pre>

  <h2>Apply 2D Filter to Data</h2>
  
  <p>
  Note: The coordinates to be used in the region definition must
  match the current coordinates of the dataset.  The default
  being Image coordinates.
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">
  In : notice2d("BOX(88.16875,75.8625,70.416667,68.508334)")
  </pre>

  <h2>Define PSF Model Parameters</h2>

  <p>
  The Sherpa <tt>set_psf</tt> function will bind a PSF model
  to a particular Sherpa session ID.
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">
  In : set_psf(psf)

  In : psf.size = [72,72]

  In : psf.center = [128,129]
  </pre>

  <h2>Define the Source Model</h2>

  <p>
  A 2D gaussian with a constant can be used to model this data
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">
  In : set_source(gauss2d.g1 + const2d.c1)

  In : c1.c0 = 1.0

  In : g1.fwhm = 6

  In : g1.xpos = 90

  In : g1.ypos = 80

  In : g1.ampl = 100

  In : freeze(g1.ellip, g1.theta, c1.c0)
  </pre>

  <h2>Fitting the PSF</h2>
  
  <p>
  With the method set to 'NelderMead', the statistic set to
  'Cash', and the PSF model convolved with the source model,
  then the data can be fit with the Sherpa <tt>fit</tt> command.
  </p>

  <pre class="screen">
  In : set_method("neldermead")
  
  In : set_stat("cash")

  In : fit()
  Dataset               = 1
  Method                = neldermead
  Statistic             = cash
  Initial fit statistic = 7648.86
  Final fit statistic   = 4066.78 at function evaluation 305
  Data points           = 4899
  Degrees of freedom    = 4895
  Change in statistic   = 3582.08
     g1.fwhm        2.80117
     g1.xpos        88.661
     g1.ypos        77.2271
     g1.ampl        166.649
  </pre>
  


  <h2>Scripting It</h2>
  
  <p>
  The files <a href="fit.py">fit.py</a> and <a
  href="fit.sl">fit.sl</a> are Python and S-Lang scripts,
  respectively, that load data from a source image and loads
  an appropriate PSF image.
